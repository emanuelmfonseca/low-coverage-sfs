# What does this folder contain?

This directory comprises four scripts designed for conducting simulations using both SLiM (with inbreeding) and msprime (without inbreeding). Scripts containing 'models' in their names define the demographic models, while those labeled 'simulations' generate unlinked SNPs under the specified demographic scenarios. It's essential to update the file paths to accurately reflect the location on your machine.
