# What does this folder contain?

This directory includes two scripts. The first script, named 'demographic_inference.py,' encompasses the entire code structure for conducting demographic inference. This encompasses the definition of the demographic model, parameters, and the process of saving the results. The primary script is named 'generate_demographic_scripts.R,' and it holds the essential details required for generating R and Slurm scripts, designed to be executed on a High-Performance Computing (HPC) system.
